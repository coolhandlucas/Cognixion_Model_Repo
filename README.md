# Cognixion Model Repo
Repo for the predictive n-gram model prototype.

Added the reddit comment data as a text file to be used as the text input for the model. Make sure to update the path of the text file within the notebook to match the path on your system before running the model. 

To access the text data download it from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y9cErbDfjfT9c0LkPNDBHCSzTJIgWqOY?usp=sharing
